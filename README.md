# Rewriting the whole framework in nim language

  This pseudo framework has evolved over time, sometimes for the better, but it's time to do it differently (and this time it works),
  until recently a new version in rust was being created, but rust is very complex and brings little productivity in my case, different from the nim language, which looks a lot like ruby and python, compiled and more ergonomic.

  The old code in all its versions will be available in previous releases, from now on all releases will be made monthly and the code will be updated as soon as possible.
